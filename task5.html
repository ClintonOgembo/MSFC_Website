              <p>As our football team's captain, I would want to draw your attention to the serious difficulties we are now facing,which are having an effect on both our performance and general enjoyment.<br>
             <p>Basic requirements including boots, a <i>full set of uniforms</i>, and <i>high quality balls</i> are desperately needed. In       addition, we struggle to prepare for away games and our training sessions due to the absence of <i>seven-a-side goalposts</i> and <i>dependable transportation.</i> In addition, the money needed to hire referees for each game puts a continuous financial burden on our team. 
             <p>All of these difficulties make it more difficult for us to compete well and keep the team spirit high. Your assistance in resolving these matters would be greatly appreciated and of immeasurable value.
